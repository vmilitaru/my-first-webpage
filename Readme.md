## Intro 

My first contact with HTML and CSS after taking the codecademy  lessons.

I remember spending some good amount of hours in building this, I must admit that at first I was a bit frustrated with my slow progress,but by the end when I saw the end result everything was forgotten.... 

It may look basic and fairly simple to you ...but for me it was quite a challenge , of which I am really proud to have accomplished !

            <section class="bio">
                <p>I am originally from Romania and I come from a mechanical engineering background. I have been working for several years in the automotive indutry, at the 
             beginning mainly as a CAD Design Engineer for <em><a href="https://group.renault.com/en/our-company/our-brands/" target="blank">Groupe Renault Nissan</a></em>  in Bucharest, <em><a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dqZko3H7lm8" target="_blank">Romania</a></em> and for the past 2 years as a Lead Engineer in the powertrain departament for <em><a href="https://www.jaguarlandrover.com/" target="blank">Jaguar Land Rover</a> </em> . 
             In april 2020, due to the global pandemic situation I was sent in furlough and at the end of august my employment contract has been terminated.
             Now I am really proud to say that I am a <em><a href="https://www.schoolofcode.co.uk/" target="blank"> School Of Code</a></em> bootcamper, and I am about to start the most challenging journey of my life. 
             No matter what the outcome will be at the end of the bootcamp I will never regret the choice of joining SOC family since coding is something which I always wanted to explore, 
             from the first day I realised that tech industry represents the future.
